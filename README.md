## Description
This project aims to analyze and cluster cryptocurrencies based on their market data using K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The analysis includes scaling data, determining the optimal number of clusters, and visualizing the clusters.

## Installation
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis. scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms, including K-Means clustering and PCA. matplotlib: For plotting basic visualizations. hvplot: For creating interactive visualizations. holoviews: For creating high-level interactive plots. bokeh: A backend for HoloViews to render the plots.


## Usage
Data analysis

## Features
Interactive scatter plots, cluster plots and line plots.

## Tests
Data Loading and Preparation:  Verify that the data is loaded correctly from the CSV file. Check if the selected features are present in the DataFrame. Ensure the data is scaled correctly. K-Means Clustering:  Test the computation of inertia values for different values of k. Verify the correct number of clusters is identified using the Elbow method. Ensure the K-Means model fits the data without errors. Check the cluster labels are correctly added to the DataFrame. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):  Ensure the PCA transformation retains the expected amount of variance. Verify the dimensionality reduction is performed correctly. Check the PCA-transformed data for consistency. Interactive Visualizations:  Verify the scatter plots are created without errors. Ensure the hover tools display the correct information.
